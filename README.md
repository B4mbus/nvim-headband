nvim-headband..
 - is **simple** - you can just install it and you are good to go
 - is **opinionated** - it doesn't give you *all the possible* cofiguration options in the world, it has two simple sections
 - has **sane defaults** - it's very likely that you won't have to change the default configuration

.. but it's still **highly configurable**! See [Configuration](#-Configuration) and [Highlights](#-Highlights).

## ðŸ–¼ Showcase

I'd like me a winbar!
![Winbar default](../media/default.png)
Although I'd like to see a little it more of the path..

Hmmm.. And it'd be nice if the location was on the right!

Ooooh! And I like bubbles, wonder if..

      -- Your configuration goes here
    }
  end
  requires = {
    { 'SmiteshP/nvim-navic' } -- required for for the navic section to work

### ðŸ”œ Soon
 1. For shortened paths an option to make them full for a second (`:toogle_short()`?)
 2. Clickable and hoverable items in sections (directories, location items)
 3. Make `unsaved_buffer` a section like file_section so that it's easier to configure it's behavior
