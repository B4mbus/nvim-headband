# Nvim-headline - a simple and opinionated winbar

</div>

Nvim-headline is a simple winbar plugin with sane defaults, that requires barely any configuration (tho is still highly configurable).


It's not meant to be a beast, it's meant to be simple and ad-hoc. If you want a powerful plugin extensible in all the possible ways use [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim).
