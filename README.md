nvim-headband..
 - is **simple** - you can just install it and you are good to go
 - is **opinionated** - it doesn't give you *all the possible* cofiguration options in the world, it has two simple sections
 - has **sane defaults** - it's very likely that you won't have to change the default configuration

.. but it's still **highly configurable**! See [Configuration](#Configuration) and [Highlights](#Highlights).
